# Tank P-23
[![tank-ci](https://github.com/AlieksieievYurii/Tank/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AlieksieievYurii/Tank/actions/workflows/main.yml)

When I was a child, I always wanted to build a tank :D However, I didn't have the required skills for that. When I grew up,
I remembered that "childhood dream" and decided to try to build a tank. The main idea is to create a fully functional military RC
tank that can shoot and has a loading mechanism.

Features:
- 4 cameras: front, back, commander, gunner
- Lights: back(Red), front, long front, gun, turret
- Laser
- Automatic Loading Mechanism
- Commander Turret
- Loading Drum can contain 6 shells
- Gun angle: -10..15 degrees
- Can shoot
